      JUDICIARY SYSTEM PROJECT
  
### What made us think of this project ?
The Indian Judiciary administers a common law system of legal jurisdiction, in which customs, precedents and legislation, all codify the law of the land. It has in fact, inherited the legacy of the legal system established by the then colonial powers and the princely states since the mid-19th century, and has partly retained characteristics of practices from the ancien and medieval times.

We have tried to formulate an android app which:
### displays all the fundamental rights of a citizen
### a person can search for the right violated in the search box
### a person can also get a list of some popular lawyers in town and fees
